   DEADLINE: <2015-05-19 Tue 21:00>

** TODO link multimethods with HMaps

** TODO talk about how MM, HMaps, Java are the major features of core.typed

** synergy between multimethods and occurrence typing

** TODO crystal clear CONTRIBUTIONS section


** TODO refer directly to examples repo

** TODO Update metatheory section with new JVM ops

** TODO Survey other JVM languages

* DONE Gradual Typing [1/1]
   DEADLINE: <2015-05-19 Tue 21:00>

* Campaign [1/3]

** TODO monkey patch load in require
** TODO blog post on REPL
- need to fix REPL in branch first
  - need to recurse into 'do' expressions
- don't want to break typed special forms
  - idea: track whether a do expression is a special form
    as you analyze it
    - ie. `(do ::t/special-form ...)` might be special, remember that...
- can we reuse c.c.t.check.do?
  - not really, takes an AST, I want a function that takes Clojure syntax

* TODO GSoC [0/1]

** TODO Merge Transients
   DEADLINE: <2015-05-23 Sat>


* TODO Digging
  need more digging for untyped gradual polymorphic things
  - better sampling

* TODO POPL Paper [0/2]
  DEADLINE: <2015-05-21 Thu>
** TODO combined type-check rewrite relation
   DEADLINE: <2015-05-20 Wed>
  takes expression
  Env exp -> type -> exp
  - added hybrid checking-rewrite judgement
  - updated everything but Java rules
  - need to
    - add back T-{Method,New,Field}
      - should rewrite from reflective to nonreflective
      - don't need reflective to reflective rule, since illtyped
    - check that T-{Method,New,Field}Static still make sense
** TODO Update proof

* TODO Gradual typing Plan
  - lay out all challenges
  - skeleton for paper

* TODO require/load finish
